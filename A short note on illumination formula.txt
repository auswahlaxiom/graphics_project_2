By the nature of graphics pipeline, for the simple rendering you'll be implementing in project 2, the fragment shader will generally be unaware whether the corresponding 3D point is in shadow or not. In particular, this could lead to negative dot products dot(N,L) or dot(N,H) popping up in some places. This can lead to multiple problems (e.g. when raising dot(N,H) to a fractional power -- nspec does not have to be an integer!, or simply the problem of negative contributions to intensity from the diffuse or specular term, which does not make sense). To avoid the problem, map all negative values to zero. In other words, replace dot(N,L) with max(dot(N,L),0.0) and dot(N,H) with max(dot(N,H),0.0) in your GLSL implementation of the Phong's formula. Note that pow(.,.) function is also provided in GLSL.
